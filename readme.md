# TurnStat V3.0.1 Client

Is a command line utility that  enables testing the basic functionality of TurnStat software.


Depedencies: 

It uses wreq for the web client part, optparse-applicate for parsing command line options/flags.


TODO:

- Reuse API key until expires.
- Implement more querying functions.
- Implement tests, to see if a TurnStat installation is working properly.
